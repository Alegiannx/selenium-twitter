# selenium-twitter
A Test Suite for Twitter written in Selenium. For the Software Quality and Testing course in ELTE (student neptune code: YWGTMU). This project was created to practice Selenium testing, and it was tailored to Twitter's HTML around the first quarter of 2021. Any changes to Twitter's web code might break this project (and probably already have).

## Execution
Simply run the tests with Gradle
```
gradle test
```
